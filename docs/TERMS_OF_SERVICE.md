**IMPORTANT:** Lutrii is a **non-custodial software tool** that facilitates subscription payments on the Solana blockchain. We **DO NOT** hold, custody, or control your funds at any time.

---

## 2. What Lutrii Is (and Isn't)

### What Lutrii IS:

✅ A **software tool** for creating recurring payment authorizations on Solana
✅ An **open-source protocol** that anyone can use, audit, or fork
✅ A **mobile interface** to interact with Solana smart contracts
✅ A **merchant discovery platform** (public data from blockchain)

### What Lutrii IS NOT:

❌ **NOT a bank** - We do not hold deposits or provide banking services
❌ **NOT a money transmitter** - We do not transmit money on your behalf
❌ **NOT a payment processor** - We do not process payments (Solana blockchain does)
❌ **NOT a custodian** - We never hold your cryptocurrency or private keys
❌ **NOT a financial advisor** - We provide software, not financial advice
❌ **NOT a merchant** - We do not sell goods or services (except the software)
❌ **NOT an escrow service** - We do not hold funds in escrow
❌ **NOT a guarantor** - We do not guarantee merchant performance or refunds

## 3. Non-Custodial Architecture

### You Control Your Funds

- **You** retain full custody of your cryptocurrency at all times
- **You** control your private keys via your wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- **You** authorize subscription payments via token delegation
- **You** can revoke authorization at any time

### We NEVER:

- Hold your private keys
- Access your wallet without your signature
- Transfer funds without your explicit authorization
- Custody your cryptocurrency
- Have the ability to reverse, refund, or stop transactions (only you can)

### Blockchain Finality

**All transactions are FINAL and IRREVERSIBLE.** Once a transaction is confirmed on the Solana blockchain:
- It **CANNOT be reversed** by Lutrii
- It **CANNOT be refunded** by Lutrii
- It **CANNOT be modified** by Lutrii

Only the merchant can issue refunds (if they choose to).

## 5. Smart Contract Risks

### Open Source, Use at Your Own Risk

- **Permissionless** - Anyone can interact with them

### Known Risks:

⚠️ **Smart contracts may contain bugs** - Despite audits, code may have undiscovered vulnerabilities
⚠️ **Blockchain is irreversible** - Transactions cannot be undone
⚠️ **Network issues** - Solana may experience downtime or congestion
⚠️ **Wallet risks** - You are responsible for securing your private keys
⚠️ **Merchant risks** - Merchants may be fraudulent or fail to deliver

### Your Responsibilities:

✅ **Audit the code yourself** (or hire someone to do it)
✅ **Use at your own risk** - Only risk what you can afford to lose
✅ **Secure your wallet** - Use hardware wallets for large amounts
✅ **Verify merchants** - Check merchant reputation before subscribing
✅ **Start small** - Test with small amounts before committing large sums

---

## 6. Dispute Resolution

### Disputes Are Between You and Merchants

2. **Request a refund** - Merchants can send refunds voluntarily
3. **Cancel your subscription** - Stop future payments immediately

### What Lutrii CAN Do:

✅ Provide transaction history (publicly visible on blockchain)
✅ Verify subscription authorization details

### What Lutrii CANNOT Do:
